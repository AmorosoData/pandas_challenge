## Data ##
Data Soft â€“ Covid-19 Pandemic -Worldwide can be exported by CSV, JSON, or Excel. However, extracting the size and amount of data made JSON difficult. We decided to use CSV. Original file contained 186k records.

*"This is the data for the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Visual Dashboard operated by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE). Also, Supported by ESRI Living Atlas Team and the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab (JHU APL)."*

Kaggle - Our second source of data comes from Kaggle: Countries population by year 2020. The file is CSV. Original file contained 235 unique values. 

*"Population in the past, present, and future. Milestones. Global Growth Rate. World population by Region and by Religion. Population Density, Fertility Rate, Median Age, Migrants. All-time population total."*
