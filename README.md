## Data ##
Data Soft – Covid-19 Pandemic -Worldwide can be exported by CSV, JSON, or Excel. However, extracting the size and amount of data made JSON difficult. We decided to use CSV. Original file contained 186k records.

*"This is the data for the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Visual Dashboard operated by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE). Also, Supported by ESRI Living Atlas Team and the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab (JHU APL)."*

Kaggle - Our second source of data comes from Kaggle: Countries population by year 2020. The file is CSV. Original file contained 235 unique values. 

*"Population in the past, present, and future. Milestones. Global Growth Rate. World population by Region and by Religion. Population Density, Fertility Rate, Median Age, Migrants. All-time population total."*

## Data Extraction - Cleanup/Transformation ##

We utilized Pandas in Jupyter Notebook to extract and clean the csv files. Cleaning the data required us to drop unnecessary columns, renaming columns, and dropping Country’s that did not appear in both datasets. We built a junction table that included all countries for our join in postgresql database.

#### Extraction – Step-by-Step Population Extraction: ####
1. Population Extraction
2.	Import dependencies
3.	Set the path for the csv
4.	Read CSV in, encode in utf-8
5.	Drop no populated rows (if there is any)
6.	Drop non-useful columns:
7.	Yearly Change
8.	Net Change
9.	Land Area (Km²)
10.	Migrants (net)
11.	Fert. Rate
12.	Med. Age
13.	Urban Pop %
14.	World Share
15.	Rename “Country (or dependency)” to “Country/Region” to work with another CSV file
16.	Sort “Country/Region” alphabetical, make sure this make this sorted list a new tabl
17.	Write new CSV, Index=False, header=True
